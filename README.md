project-template
================

A high-level project template including scripts of generating front-end/back-end sub-project template

This intends to do the following:

1. init-backend.sh [sub-project]
2. init-frontend.sh [sub-project]
3. commit.sh [comment] [branch]

This is mainly for speeding up developing my projects.
All are welcome to fork and improve this template.
