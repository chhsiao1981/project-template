project-template
================

A high-level project template including scripts of generating front-end/back-end sub-project template

This intends to do the following:

1. scripts/init.sh (restart .git and init default frontend and backend sub-projects)
2. scripts/init_git.sh (restart .git)
3. scripts/init-frontend.sh [sub-project] (init frontend sub-projects)
4. scripts/init-backend.sh [sub-project] (init backend sub-projects)
5. scripts/commit.sh [comment] [branch] (commit)
6. scripts/deploy_master.sh (deploy master to production machines)
7. scripts/deploy_dev.sh [branch] (deploy branch to test machines)

This is mainly for speeding up developing my projects.
All are welcome to fork and improve this template.
